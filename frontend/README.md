## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   _Note: We use `--legacy-peer-deps` due to some compatibility issues with Three.js dependencies_

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Development Notes

- The app uses React 18 with concurrent features
- Three.js integration requires specific peer dependency handling
- All 3D visualizations are optimized for performance on mobile devices

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.
